# Leetcoding

# The Solutions are organised in their own individual folder
**_NOTE:_**  Most of the solutions are in Java

- The folders follows a structure of: "Problem Number. Problem Name".

- The Solution.java outside of the folders is used for testing and debugging, it also includes some problems that I am currently stuck on.

- The other classes are Leetcode's Data Structures, required for some of the solutions.
